Debugging - trace-options

Trace options provide additional debug capabilities. When enabled 
beneath a protocol, messages log to the debug priority under the 
corresponding subsystem.

Enable trace-options:

1. network-instance <name> protocols <type> trace-options flag 

<flag type>
For example: network-instance default protocols bgp 
trace-options flag keepalive

View where trace-options are enabled:

1.

info from state network-instance default protocols bgp trace-
options

2.

info from state network-instance system logging 

Configure log location example - (send to a console using messages 
sourced from bgp with a severity of “debug”):

1. system logging <send to location> subsystem <name> priority 

<type> <value in brackets>
For example: system logging console subsystem bgp 
priority match-exact [debug]
