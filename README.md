# llm-router-interface
Trying to build a natural language interface for network devices.

This repository is treated as a personal note to myself for the project.

Most of the files are iteration of same thing. Start working from last one, middleware10.py.

pdf_utils.py and clean.py were used to make the text file for giving context to LLMs.
